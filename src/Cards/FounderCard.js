                <p>
                    Poly was conceived in 2015 by Kamel Greene in Provo, Utah. As a football 
                    transfer from Washington State University to Brigham Young University, 
                    Kamel found himself in a new area with a new culture. As a non-LDS student-
                    athlete, he was outside of the social circles of BYUâ€™s campus.
                    

                    Kamel attempted to find clubs and activities of interest to him, but it was 
                    unclear where he should look to find such campus resources. He struggled 
                    to adjust to his first year at BYU. Kamel felt alone, but no one would have known. 
                    On Social Media, he had 5,000 followers, but in reality, he only knew two. 
                    What Kamel was lacking was genuine social interaction, but he was not alone. 
                    The latest research shows that 70% of university students reported feeling lonely. 
                    Such feelings of isolation not only exist among students, but among adults 
                    as well, and challenges with mental health have become a public health crisis. 

                    The Poly Platform seeks to address the growing lack of genuine social 
                    communication among adolescents and adults. Through partnerships 
                    with companies, cities, and schools, we believe we can help to facilitate 
                    real belonging and civic engagement.
