                    Poly is a platform that uses technology as an access 
                    way for face to face interaction. Many people resort to 
                    social media to try and further the development of 
                    relationships. The problem is that social media 
                    facilitates the lack of genuine interactions, which 
                    leads to loneliness. Poly will foster interest selection 
                    to help diminish isolation and further develop a better 
                    sense of belonging.
