            <p>
                One of the most significant challenges companies, 
                cities, and schools face is creating an environment 
                where people can comfortably engage with one another. 

                As administrators look to increase involvement within 
                their institutions, social media has become the foundation 
                upon which they rely for engagement. 

                Although social media acts as a communication enhancer, 
                it is the culprit of in-genuine online engagement. Such a lack 
                of ingenuity fosters loneliness and isolation among 
                adults and students.
